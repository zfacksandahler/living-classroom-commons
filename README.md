# Living Classroom Commons

Welcome to our shared digital commons—a space where we weave together our individual perspectives, community connections, and nature explorations into a holistic tapestry of learning.

This repository is more than a collection of files; it is a living document of our class's growing relationship with the world. Every contribution, from a story about a local helper to a seasonal observation of a tree, is a thread that connects us to each other, our community, and the natural systems we are part of.

Here we honor the unique voice of each learner and recognize that knowledge is co‑created through respectful collaboration. We document not just what we learn, but *how* we learn—through inquiry, dialogue, and reflection.

## How This Space Works

We use three main folders to organize our explorations:

*   **`community-connections/`** – Stories, interviews, and reflections about the people and roles that make our community thrive.
*   **`nature-explorations/`** – Observations, drawings, and notes about the plants, animals, and natural cycles we encounter.
*   **`our-systems/`** – Investigations into the systems that shape our lives (transportation, food, energy, communication, etc.) and how they connect to the wider world.

Each of these facets is interconnected, just as our classroom is connected to the home, the neighborhood, and the larger ecosystem.

## Getting Started

If you have an idea for a contribution, start by opening an **Issue** to describe it. Once you’re ready to share your work, create a **Pull Request** that adds your file to the appropriate folder. Our collaborative review process ensures every voice is heard and every contribution is woven into the whole.

Let’s build this commons together—one story, one observation, one connection at a time.
