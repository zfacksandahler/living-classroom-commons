# Contributing to Our Living Classroom Commons

Welcome! This document outlines how we collaborate in this digital commons. Our process is designed to honor each learner's voice while building a shared resource that reflects our interconnected learning.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Share an Idea (Create an Issue)
If you have an idea for something to add—a community story, a nature observation, a system investigation—start by creating an **Issue**.

*   Go to the **Issues** tab and click "New issue".
*   Give your idea a clear title (e.g., "Idea: Interview a local farmer").
*   In the description, explain what you'd like to explore and why it matters.
*   Add the label `enhancement` (or another appropriate label).
*   Assign the issue to yourself if you plan to work on it, or leave it open for others to pick up.

This step helps us see what everyone is thinking about and allows for discussion before work begins.

### 2. Create Your Contribution (Work on a Branch)
When you're ready to turn your idea into a file:

*   **Create a new branch** for your work. Give it a descriptive name, such as `add-farmer-interview`.
*   **Add your file** to the appropriate folder:
    *   `community-connections/` for stories about people and roles in our community.
    *   `nature-explorations/` for observations of plants, animals, seasons, etc.
    *   `our-systems/` for investigations of how things work together (transport, food, energy, etc.).
*   Write your contribution in **Markdown** (`.md`) format. Include your name and the date if you like, and feel free to add images, drawings, or links.

### 3. Submit for Review (Open a Pull Request)
Once your file is ready:

*   Go to the **Pull Requests** tab and click "New pull request".
*   Select your branch as the source and `main` as the target.
*   Write a clear title that describes what you're adding (e.g., "Add interview with local farmer").
*   In the description, briefly explain your contribution and reference the original issue by typing `Closes #X` (where `X` is the issue number).
*   Click "Create pull request".

### 4. Review and Feedback
Every contribution is reviewed by at least one other person (a classmate or the teacher). The reviewer will:

*   Read your work carefully.
*   Leave constructive comments, asking questions or suggesting connections to other parts of our commons.
*   Approve the pull request when it's ready to be integrated.

### 5. Merge into the Commons
Once approved, the pull request is merged using **"Squash and merge"**. This keeps our history clean and treats each contribution as a complete idea added to the whole. After merging, the feature branch is deleted.

## Guidelines for Respectful Collaboration

*   **Be kind and constructive** in both issues and pull request comments.
*   **Celebrate each other's perspectives**—every voice adds a unique thread to our tapestry.
*   **Connect ideas** when you can. If your contribution relates to something already in the commons, mention it!
*   **Keep files focused** on one topic or experience.
*   **Use simple, clear language**; remember that our commons is for everyone in our class.

By following this process, we not only build a rich digital resource—we also practice the skills of collaboration, critical feedback, and collective knowledge-building that are essential for lifelong learning.

Happy contributing!
